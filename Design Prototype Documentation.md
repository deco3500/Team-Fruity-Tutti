##Summary:
Team Fruitti Tutti has been working on The Beacon for the past semester in DECO3500. The Beacon is an online digital news source that allows users to select a level of digital literacy and interact with friends through a pin-story social board while also solving the journalistic issue of sensationalism by only showing “good-news” stories. The key aim for the app is to make digital news engaging for the elderly (65+) as usually they are not willing to switch from traditional mediums such as TV, radio and newspapers. As our app has a socially-immersive concept, digital literacy levels and is non-sensationalist, through testing we have found that the elderly are likely to switch to this new online medium.

##Research


###Academic Research:
In order to understand the problem space completely, research was carried out on our target group, the elderly aged over 65. Initially we were focusing on digital literacy in elderly people and how they would rather use traditional mediums of journalism rather than entering the digital age. From this we found that approximately, only 20 percent of senior Australians own a smartphone. Senior Australians often cite a lack of confidence and knowledge as one of the main reasons for not participating online (Liberal Party of Australia, 2016). 


Just over a half of Australians aged 65 or over use the internet while the corresponding figure of those aged 15-17 is 98.6%. The big drop-off in use is between those aged 55-64 (81%) and those in the oldest age group (Theconversation.com, 2016). This infers that the elderly demographic are less likely to learn new technology or use the web to get their news. Learning becomes “optional” later in life and therefore elderly people lose the motivation to learn. This is why they have difficulty learning new technologies (Chen, 2012). 


From this research we then wanted to figure out how we could engage elderly people to use digital mediums of news. A CSIRO study found that 50 to 60 percent of Australian elderlies (living residentially) suffer from loneliness or indicate that they are lonely. The main causes of loneliness in the elderly are that they don’t have easy access to community groups, are living alone, have been widowed or even just believe that there is no one supporting them. The CSIRO also noted that one of the most effective interventions to reduce loneliness includes developing community networks by utilising existing community resources and familiar concepts(Grenade & Boldy, 2008). 


Our research direction also led us to understand that sensationalism in the news is a large issue in the elderly community. Newspapers tend to play up and dwell on stories that are of the sensationalised variety (for example, car crashes, murder, kidnapping) (“Current Problems in the Media,” 2016). A study found that elderly people avoid programs with sensational aspects (Kleemans, 2007). The issue of sensationalism may cause anxiety in the elderly generation, of which anxiety disorders at least two times more frequent than depression in the elderly (Gauthier, 2005).


###Primary Research:
After researching our problem space, we then went directly to target users to construct a concept of our target user group. Initially, as it was difficult to find lonely individuals over the age of 65, 5 middle aged to elderly participants from a local church group were used as the research demographic (Test Group A). From these meetings, personas were generated (see personas A, B & C on github). Key findings from research indicated that the group mainly got their news from traditional sources such as radio, TV and physical newspaper. It was also identified that they feel like they are being left behind with the large amount of new technology on the market and find that concepts they’re used to are comforting. For some participants, getting news from a digital source had never occurred to them. Most have some form of social interaction at church and work, however do not make the effort to socialise outside of church hours or work hours.


As well as Test Group A, we had a primary user tester called Bob (figure 1) who is 76 and specifically the type of person we envision our application will be used by (Test Group B). He spends up to two hours per day getting the news via word of mouth, TV, radio and newspaper mediums. Although he belongs to community groups such as church and the Toowoomba local radio station, he does not socialise outside those hours and gets quite lonely.

###Design Research:
Design research into the best way to engage elderly users and cater to their needs was also carried out. From the research, we found that it is difficult for older demographics to read text that is small and close. Colour vision also declines with age (difficult to distinguish between similar colours). Hearing also declines and the elderly experience hearing loss. Due to poor motor control, older people tend to have trouble hitting interface targets that aren’t clearly defined (Friedman, 2016). We will need to include solutions to these features in the final design and in order to ensure that the elderly generation can use the application, it will be tested on the target group.

##Requirements:
From our research, we have identified that elderly people, aged 65+ are unlikely to use digital mediums to get their news. Our aim will be to make digital news engaging for the elderly so that they move away from their traditional mediums and into the new technology age. In order to engage the elderly, we will address the journalistic issue of sensationalism by focusing on only showing “good news” community stories. This will ensure that the users do not get distressed or anxiety attacks from sensationalised news that is traditionally shown in TV, radio and newspaper. 


To ensure our app caters to all levels of reading and digital ability, four levels of digital literacy will be selectable. The first level will include text only, the second level will include text and image, the third level will include text, image and video and the fourth level will include text, image, video and social media. Having this wide variety of selection will ensure that the elderly users feel comfortable using the app. This will also pull on emotional design, in that they can choose a medium they’re used to (ie. text and image is similar to newspaper). 


We have also decided to focus on social isolation in the elderly as well as digital literacy and our research has highlighted that 50 to 60 percent of Australians living residentially suffer from loneliness due to living by themselves or not having much social interaction. We also found that a key intervention to reducing loneliness for the elderly includes developing community networks, which is what we were thinking of doing with our concept. We believe that this could be a core motivator in getting the elderly to engage in a digital news medium.


We have decided that to ensure our application embodies a community focus we will create a “bulletin” type of board where the users can pin stories they find interesting to. They would also be able to see stories their friends have pinned. The stories highlighted in red will represent the stories they’ve pinned and the stories highlighted blue will represent the stories from other community members.


One of the sources we found also mentioned that the most effective intervention in reducing loneliness was utilising existing community resources to make the elderly feel more comfortable and in this case that would be the bulletin board.This would also incorporate elements of emotional design.


We believe that this combination of un-sensationalised news, levels of digital literacy and a social board for pinning stories to will help ease the transition from traditional to digital news easier and make engaging in online news mediums exciting for the elderly.


To ensure our design caters to the elderly, the following design elements will be taken into consideration:
* The user interface is kept simple so that the elderly don’t get confused
* Font sizes smaller than 16 pixels are avoided
* Contrast ratios between text and background colour are considered
* Distance between key functions are considered to ensure motor control is acceptable
* The website is resizable so that it can be used on a mobile/ ipad interface or on the web
