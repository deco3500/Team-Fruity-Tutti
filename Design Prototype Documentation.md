##Summary:
Team Fruitti Tutti has been working on The Beacon for the past semester in DECO3500. The Beacon is an online digital news source that allows users to select a level of digital literacy and interact with friends through a pin-story social board while also solving the journalistic issue of sensationalism by only showing “good-news” stories. The key aim for the app is to make digital news engaging for the elderly (65+) as usually they are not willing to switch from traditional mediums such as TV, radio and newspapers. As our app has a socially-immersive concept, digital literacy levels and is non-sensationalist, through testing we have found that the elderly are likely to switch to this new online medium.

##Research


###Academic Research:
In order to understand the problem space completely, research was carried out on our target group, the elderly aged over 65. Initially we were focusing on digital literacy in elderly people and how they would rather use traditional mediums of journalism rather than entering the digital age. From this we found that approximately, only 20 percent of senior Australians own a smartphone. Senior Australians often cite a lack of confidence and knowledge as one of the main reasons for not participating online (Liberal Party of Australia, 2016). 


Just over a half of Australians aged 65 or over use the internet while the corresponding figure of those aged 15-17 is 98.6%. The big drop-off in use is between those aged 55-64 (81%) and those in the oldest age group (Theconversation.com, 2016). This infers that the elderly demographic are less likely to learn new technology or use the web to get their news. Learning becomes “optional” later in life and therefore elderly people lose the motivation to learn. This is why they have difficulty learning new technologies (Chen, 2012). 


From this research we then wanted to figure out how we could engage elderly people to use digital mediums of news. A CSIRO study found that 50 to 60 percent of Australian elderlies (living residentially) suffer from loneliness or indicate that they are lonely. The main causes of loneliness in the elderly are that they don’t have easy access to community groups, are living alone, have been widowed or even just believe that there is no one supporting them. The CSIRO also noted that one of the most effective interventions to reduce loneliness includes developing community networks by utilising existing community resources and familiar concepts(Grenade & Boldy, 2008). 


Our research direction also led us to understand that sensationalism in the news is a large issue in the elderly community. Newspapers tend to play up and dwell on stories that are of the sensationalised variety (for example, car crashes, murder, kidnapping) (“Current Problems in the Media,” 2016). A study found that elderly people avoid programs with sensational aspects (Kleemans, 2007). The issue of sensationalism may cause anxiety in the elderly generation, of which anxiety disorders at least two times more frequent than depression in the elderly (Gauthier, 2005).


Primary Research:
After researching our problem space, we then went directly to target users to construct a concept of our target user group. Initially, as it was difficult to find lonely individuals over the age of 65, 5 middle aged to elderly participants from a local church group were used as the research demographic (Test Group A). From these meetings, personas were generated (see personas A, B & C on github). Key findings from research indicated that the group mainly got their news from traditional sources such as radio, TV and physical newspaper. It was also identified that they feel like they are being left behind with the large amount of new technology on the market and find that concepts they’re used to are comforting. For some participants, getting news from a digital source had never occurred to them. Most have some form of social interaction at church and work, however do not make the effort to socialise outside of church hours or work hours.


As well as Test Group A, we had a primary user tester called Bob (figure 1) who is 76 and specifically the type of person we envision our application will be used by (Test Group B). He spends up to two hours per day getting the news via word of mouth, TV, radio and newspaper mediums. Although he belongs to community groups such as church and the Toowoomba local radio station, he does not socialise outside those hours and gets quite lonely.
