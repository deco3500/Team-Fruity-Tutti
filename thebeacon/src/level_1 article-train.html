			<h1 id="articleTitle">URGENT MEETING CALLED FOR QUEENSLAND RAIL BOARD FOLLOWING CUTS TO 100 SERVICES IN BRISBANE</h1>
			<h3 class="byline" id="author">By ABC NEWS</h3>

				<b><span class="firstcharacter">Q</span>ueensland Rail's (QR) board has been ordered to hold an urgent meeting this weekend to work out interim arrangements following major disruptions to Brisbane's network due to a lack of drivers.</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				More than 100 trains were cancelled on Friday because not enough drivers were trained to operate the new Redcliffe Peninsula line, which opened earlier this month.
			</p>
			<p>
				QR's chief executive Helen Gluer apologised for the disruptions, saying QR underestimated staffing and training requirements for the new service.
			</p>
			<p>
				Transport Minister Stirling Hinchliffe has since ordered the QR board to meet this weekend to sort it out.
			</p>
			<p>
				He wants interim arrangements put in place immediately to restore services across the network.
			</p>
			<p>
				HQueensland Council of Unions assistant general secretary Michael Clifford said driver shortages were a legacy of the former Newman government's public service cutbacks.
			</p>
			<p>
				"If they hadn't cut the training programs and if they hadn't cut the recruitment of staff we wouldn't be having the problems we are having today," he said.
			</p>
			<p>
				QR is hoping to release an interim timetable by Monday that will be in place until more drivers are trained.
