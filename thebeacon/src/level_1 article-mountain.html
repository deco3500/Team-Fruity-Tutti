				<b><span class="firstcharacter">T</span>he first woman to climb Mount Everest, Junko Tabei, has died aged 77.The Japanese climber had been diagnosed with cancer and died at a hospital outside of Tokyo.</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				Tabei reached the summit of the world's highest mountain in 1975, at the age of 35.
			</p>
			<p>
				In 1992, she also became the first woman to complete the Seven Summits, reaching the highest peaks of the seven continents.
			</p>
			<p>
				Tabei climbed her first mountain in 1939, when she was led by her elementary school teacher to the summit of Mt Nasu, her official website states.
			</p>
			<p>
				She later established the Ladies Climbing Club: Japan, with the slogan "Let's go on an overseas expedition by ourselves".
			</p>
			<p>
				Back in 1970s Japan, it was still widely considered that men were the ones to work outside and women would stay at home," Tabei told the Japan Times in 2012.
			</p>
			<p>
				"Even women who had jobs â€” they were asked just to serve tea."
			</p>
			<p>
				When she left on her Everest expedition, as part of a 15-member, all-women team, "we were told we should be raising children instead", she told the newspaper.
			</p>

			<p>
				"There was never a question in my mind that I wanted to climb that mountain, no matter what other people said."
			</p>
			<p>
				She had continued climbing later in life, and her website said she went abroad "seven to eight times a year to climb the highest mountain of each country".
			</p>
			<p>
				As of 2008, Tabei had climbed the highest peaks of 56 countries, it stated.
			</p>
			<p>
				Tabei was married with two children.
			</p>
			<p>
				She completed a degree in English and American Literature at Showa Women's University in 1962, and a master's degree in comparative social culture, focusing on garbage problems in the Himalayas, at Kyusha University in 2000.
			</p>
			<p>
				She campaigned for sustainable mountaineering and was chairperson of the Himalayan Adventure Trust of Japan, which is dedicated to the protection of mountain environments.
