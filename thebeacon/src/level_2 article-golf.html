			<h1 id="articleTitle">AUSTRALIAN GOLF CLUBS LOOKING TO ATTRACT NEW MEMBERS AFTER TOUGH DECADE FOR THE SPORT</h1>
			<h3 class="byline" id="author">By Scott Rollinson</h3>

			<p>
				<b><span class="firstcharacter">O</span>ctober is golf's equivalent of an open house, with clubs around the country throwing open their doors as they go on a membership drive.</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				One of the most popular games in the world, golf has been bleeding members for more than a decade as time and financial pressures take their toll on potential recruits.
			</p>
			<p>
				It has forced some clubs to close their doors and others to merge with their neighbouring courses.
			</p>
			<p>
				The game's governing body is steadfast though that golf is not dead - instead, they are now working on ways to attract a new breed of golfer.
			</p>
			<p>
				<h3>"It had been declining really since 2000," said Steve Pitt, Golf Australia's chief executive</h3>
			</p>
			<p>
				In 2006, 446,428 golfers were members of a local club. In the 10 years since, however, that number has fallen by almost 50,000.
			</p>
			<p>
				But that is not the only number of concern for those running the game - more than 50 per cent of those currently a member of a golf club are aged above 55.
			</p>
			<p>
				Pitt says those running the game realised they needed to take action.
			</p>
			<p>
				"It's only a small decline, but it adds up over a period of time," he said.
			</p>

			<p>
				"That was the trend in Australian sports and organised sport.
			</p>
			<p>
				"I don't think we ever felt like we were in trouble but I think we felt like we needed to raise the profile of golf to attract members.
			</p>
			<p>
				"We've seen clubs face challenges, we've seen costs continuing to go up and revenues not really growing to meet those costs."
			</p>
			<p>
				The old club golfer was gone. No longer were people playing at the same time, with the same people, at the same club each week.
			</p>
			<p>
				"Almost the majority of golfers don't fit that category anymore," Golf Tasmania's Simon Weston said.
			</p>
			<p>
				<h3>T"Five or six hours on a Saturday is not as popular as it once was so clubs have to adapt."</h3>
			</p>
			<p>
				After 25 years as a member of Kingswood Golf Club in Victoria, come 2018 John Mark will be walking a different fairway.
			</p>
			<p>
				He is club golfer that has seen his club go through a merger to survive.
			</p>
			<p>
				"Falling memberships, increasing costs, it's just one of those things that fees would have had to have gone up to a level that's unacceptable," he said.
			</p>
			<p>
				"Some of the top sand-belt clubs (in Victoria) will never have an issue, but the other clubs I think are struggling as a whole to keep the clubs going."
			</p>
			<p>
				John Mark was a supporter as his club merged with Peninsula Golf Club.
			</p>
			<p>
				"It's kept the Kingswood name alive, it's kept the club alive," he said.
			</p>
			<p>
				"It's given all the Kingswood members the opportunity to move to another location and keep playing golf."
			</p>

			<p>
				<h2>Tourism push</h2>
			</p>
			<p>
			Golf Australia say the membership numbers do not fully tell the story of the game's state of health.
			</p>
			<p>
			While club numbers have slid over the past decade, golf tourism has blossomed.
			</p>
			<p>
			"When we talk about golf tourism, there is a whole new opportunity there for Australia," Pitt said.
			</p>
			<p>
			"We'd like to do more with the Federal Government around the tourism space.
			</p>
			<p>
			"We think there is enormous opportunity to do that, we've seen New Zealand do a better job then what has happened in Australia to deliver results.
			</p>
			<p>
			"We've got some remarkable golf courses, I think we've got around 10 in the top 100 in the world and some of the best venues in the world and Australia is a fantastic place to come and play golf because those venues are all pretty accessible."
			</p>
			<p>
				Tasmania is one area ready to capitalise on the tourism boom.
			</p>
			<p>
				"We have world class golf courses that people want to experience and they'll come back and bring their friends so it's great for Tasmanian tourism and golf in general," Weston said.
			</p>
			<p>
				<h2>New ideas</h2>
			</p>
			<p>
				"Golf has been a fairly conservative sport over a number of years, I think now we're starting to do more and be more open to new ideas, new ideas around membership and product offerings, so that will bear results I have no doubt," Pitt said.
			</p>
			<p>
				Those new ideas are both simple and radical.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the simplest form, clubs are offering flexible memberships, and trying to tailor memberships to meet the need of the individual.
			</p>
			<p>
				"We're all time poor, we have so much going on in our lives and that's where sports have got to be flexible," Pitt said.
			</p>
			<p>
				<h3>"For golf I think the key challenge is time but beyond that, how do you make clubs and facilities more family orientated?"</h3>
			</p>
			<p>
				The more radical involves freshening up golf's image to attract new players.
			</p>
			<p>
				The game has started more novelty offerings like foot golf (played with a soccer ball and large holes), swing fit (a combination of on-course fitness programs and golf techniques) and speed golf (where players run between shots to speed up the time a round takes).
			</p>
			<p>
				"These ideas are still a bit embryonic, but they're growing all the time," Mr Pitt said.
			</p>
			<p>
				There is no doubt that golf has been through a rough patch at a grassroots level.
			</p>
			<p>
				Fittingly, a game that involves patience, is now waiting to see an upward swing.
