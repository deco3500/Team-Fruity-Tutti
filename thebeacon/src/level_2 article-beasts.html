				<b><span class="firstcharacter">T</span>he first full trailer for JK Rowling's Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is finally here.</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				Based on a 2001 book by Rowling, Fantastic Beasts purports to be a copy of Harry Potter's textbook – about the magical creatures of the Potter universe – first mentioned in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. Rowling has also penned the screenplay – her first foray into writing movies.
			</p>
			<p>
				The movie, released in Australia on November 17, is about a power struggle within the secretive American wizardry community.
			</p>
			<p>
				Newt Scamander, played by Eddie Redmayne, appears to have landed in 1920s America.
			</p>
			<p>
				Harry Potter fans may know Scamander as the older author of Fantastic Beasts – but 70 years earlier, he was a young magizoologist, collecting magical creatures and storing them in his briefcase. Of course, it doesn't take long for them to escape and start terrorising the residents of Manhattan.
			</p>
			<p>
				According to Wired, the trailer hints at film that looks "part Potterverse, part Gotham, part The Crucible".
			</p>
			<p>
				We see a winged Thunderbird, and Scamander hiding in a subway station from what appear to be magical bats.
			</p>
			<p>
				"The debate seems to be over whether American wizards should expose themselves to "no-majes" (non-magic people), flying in the face of an extremist organisation called the New Salem Philanthropic Society," The Verge reports.
			</p>
			<p>
				"Someone suggests that this might instigate a war! It's all very dramatic, but looks beautiful. Plus, that familiar Harry Potter score is back – if you're susceptible to crippling nostalgia it might not be safe for work."
			</p>

			<p>
				"Preaching to her sinister followers, the grim-countenanced leader of the witch-murdering New Salem Philanthropic Society seems to be adopting a scorched-earth, divide-and-conquer policy in her efforts to convince New York that it is under threat from sinister unseen magical forces."
			</p>
			<p>
				The film is directed by David Yates, who helmed the last four Harry Potter blockbusters.
