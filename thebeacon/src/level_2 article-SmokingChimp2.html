				<span class="firstcharacter">P </span>YONGYANG’S newly opened Central Zoo has a new star: Azalea, the smoking chimpanzee.</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				The troubling images show the female chimp lighting up cigarette after cigarette like a pro, and is said to smoke “about a pack a day”.
			</p>
			<p>
				They insist, however, she doesn’t inhale.
			</p>
			<p>
				Thrown a lighter by a zoo trainer, the chimpanzee lights her own cigarettes. If a lighter isn’t available, she can light up from lit cigarette if one is tossed her way.
			</p>
			<p>
				Such a sight would be cringe-worthy in most other countries around the world, though it seemed to delight visitors who roared with laughter on Wednesday as the chimpanzee (whose Korean name is ‘Dalle’), one of two at the zoo, sat puffing away as her trainer egged her on. The trainer also prompted her to touch her nose, bow thank you and do a simple dance.
			</p>
			<p>
				The zoo is pulling in thousands of visitors a day with a slew of attractions ranging from such typical fare as elephants, giraffes, penguins and monkeys to a hi-tech natural history museum with displays showing the origins of the solar system and the evolution of life on Earth.
			</p>
			<p>
				Another of the most popular attractions that might come as a surprise to foreign visitors is the dog pavilion, which has everything from German shepherds to Shih Tsus. The zoo also has performances featuring other animals trained to do tricks, including a monkey that slam dunks basketballs, dogs trained to appear as though they can do addition on subtraction on an abacus and doves that fly around and land on a woman skating on an indoor stage.
			</p>
			<p>
				News.com.au contacted PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) for comment on the images and they suggested that zoos such as this are purely interested in financial gain, with little regard for the animals involved.
			</p>
			<p>
				“If we really needed any more proof that zoos are motivated by profit and not animal welfare, this is surely it. Smoking is as dangerous to Azalea the chimpanzee as it is to humans, and yet her ‘caretakers’ facilitate her habit — just for the sake of a few cheap laughs and more bodies coming through the gates,” PETA Australia’s associate director of campaigns Ashley Fruno said.
			</p>

			<p>
				“Anyone who cares about protecting animals should donate to programs that help them in their natural habitats, where they’re free to engage in natural behaviour, and stay away from these glorified prisons that objectify sensitive animals.”
			</p>
			<p>
				Renovations for the new zoo began in 2014, as part of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s efforts to create more modern and impressive structures and leisure centres around the capital. The zoo actually dates back to 1959, when Kim Il Sung, the nation’s first leader and the grandfather of Kim Jong Un, ordered it built on the outskirts of the city.
			</p>
			<p>
				According to its official history, the zoo started off with only 50 badgers
