				<b><span class="firstcharacter">H</span> undreds of people have marched in Barcelona to protest the return of bullfighting to the Spanish city.
				</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				Spain's Constitutional Court on Thursday overruled Catalonia's regional ban on bullfighting, saying the prohibition violated a national law protecting the controversial spectacle and it was exempt from being prohibited at a regional level.
			</p>
			<p>
				The court called it a cultural asset protected under national law in the ruling, which is likely to fuel political tensions between the region and Madrid.
			</p>
			<p>
				Bullfighting has been popular in Spain for generations, but its appeal has waned as animal rights activists and a generation of Spaniards exposed to less traditional values question the legitimacy of an activity they say is barbaric and archaic.
			</p>
			<p>
				Shortly after the ruling, Spanish animal rights political party Pacma called for protest as part of its so-called "Mission Abolition".
			</p>
			<p>
				It said it would continue to fight to end bull-related spectacles at a national level, saying on Twitter: "We will not rest until it is abolished in all of Spain".
			</p>
			<p>
				The group called for more protests to be held in Madrid and other Spanish cities.
			</p>
			<p>
				Barcelona is the capital of Catalonia, a wealthy region in the country's north east with its own language and customs and a strong and active independence movement.
			</p>
			<p>
				<h2>'There will be no bullfights in Catalonia again'</h2>
			</p>
			<p>
				The region became the first part of mainland Spain to outlaw the spectacle in 2012.
			</p>
			<p>
				But the move was also seen as a step in the Catalan Government's push to break away from Spain.

			<p>
				Having already refused to accept a ruling from the same court invalidating Catalonia's pursuit of independence, authorities in the region indicated they would ignore Thursday's verdict too.
			</p>
			<p>
				"There will be no bullfights in Catalonia again," Catalonian MP Josep Rull said.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				A long-running dispute with the central Government over Catalonia's independence drive was sharpened in early October when the region's Parliament voted to hold a referendum on secession next September.
