![alt text](titlepage.png "Title page")

Team Fruity Tutti have chosen the project “The Beacon” to work on throughout the semester.  

THE PROBLEM
How do you deliver new stories to citizens with limited computing and internet skills and enable them to engage with these stories in a way that is simple to use, elegant, informative, doesn’t look or feel remedial and is no longer paper based?

TECHNICAL SOLUTION
The Beacon is a technological solution to the journalistic problem of not being able to provide news to all citizens due to their varied digital literacy levels. This application would assist these citizens to consume media in a safe and simple way. The application would have different levels of functionality. 

First level would show text and image based news stories. 
Second level would show text and image and video based news stories. 
Third level would show text and images, video and audio based new stories. 
Fourth level would show text and images, video, audio and social media based news stories. By having these different “levels” of functionality the application will be able to cater to a wider audience of users.
